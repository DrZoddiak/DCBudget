# What is this
This is a simple project that is used for rendering a CSV from a budget report produced by the DOS in the DemocracyCraft CityRP server.

## How do I use it?
`java -jar <jar>`

The first time you run it, it should create 2 directories wherever it's at. `input` and `output`

The input directory should also generate with a `budget.txt` file where you will paste the produced budget report from
the DOS.
You do not have to remove the text that is generated by this application, but you may.

If you run it again it should generate a CSV of the report in the `output` directory.

## How do I build this to get a jar?
`gradle build` should be sufficient to create a jar that is runnable with the above command.
